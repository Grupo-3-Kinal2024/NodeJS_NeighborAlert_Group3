This project aims to develop a web application using Node.js, React, and MongoDB to address the problem of managing community reports. The application serves as a centralized platform where members of a community, such as those in a neighborhood, residential area, or municipality, can submit and manage reports on various local issues. These reports can range from infrastructure problems like damaged streets to requests for community support and assistance. The system includes three main roles—administrative, community manager, and user—each with specific functionalities to ensue efficient handling and resolution of reports.
