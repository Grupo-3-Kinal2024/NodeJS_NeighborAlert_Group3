##### CONFIGS DIRECTORY EXPLANATION

   The "configs" folder houses essential files for the configuration and proper functioning of the application. 
   Here's a breakdown of what this folder contains:

   1. server.js: This file serves as the core of the application. It's responsible for starting the server 
               and configuring all necessary routes and middlewares for the application to run correctly. 
               Additionally, it provides the logic for connecting to the database and defines routes for 
               various API endpoints.

   2. mongo.js: This file contains the necessary configuration to establish a connection with the MongoDB 
               database. It doesn't require modification, as it's preconfigured to establish the connection 
               correctly.

   The "configs" folder is crucial for the proper functioning of the application, as it contains the core logic 
   and configuration needed to start and run the server, as well as to establish a connection with the database.

   Furthermore, it's important to note that these files should be handled with caution, as they contain sensitive 
   configurations critical to the operation of the application.

   ---

   The "data" folder is to add data that will be used for testing. 
   Collections from the database should be uploaded to the "data/collections" directory, 
   and endpoints should be uploaded to the "data/endpoints" directory. 
   
   This setup facilitates testing of these components to ensure their functionality before deployment to production 
   environments, while also maintaining the security of sensitive information.

   ---

   Note: Ensure to maintain the security of these files and avoid exposing sensitive information, 
   such as database credentials, in public repositories or production environments.

   Description of the "data" directory:

   The "data" directory will be solely used for testing environments, ensuring that no sensitive information is compromised here.



##### SOURCE CODE DIRECTORY EXPLANATION

   Within the src directory, we organize our codebase into distinct modules and supporting components 
   to enhance clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Here's a breakdown of each directory and its purpose:

   1. auth:
      This directory hosts functionalities related to the authentication process. 
      Primarily, it handles user authentication and authorization tasks. 
      It's important to note that the auth module stands independently outside the modules directory 
      due to its critical role in securing the application.

   2. helpers:
      The helpers directory contains utility functions or a collection of functions that offer commonly 
      used functionalities across the application. These functions aim to streamline development by 
      providing reusable code for tasks such as data manipulation, formatting, or other routine operations.

   3. middlewares:
      Middleware components reside within the middlewares directory. Middleware, in our context, acts as 
      a bridge between different parts of the application, facilitating communication and interactions. 
      Common middleware tasks include request processing, authentication, logging, error handling, and input 
      validation. Frameworks like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python) are often utilized here to streamline 
      these processes.

   4. modules:
      The modules directory serves as the primary container for encapsulating distinct features or functionalities 
      of the application. Each module resides within its own subdirectory, maintaining a clear separation of concerns. 
      
      For instance:

         - modules/user: Contains functionality related to user management.
         - modules/community: Focuses on community-related features.

      Within each module directory, you'll find the following files:

         - module_name.controller.js: Logic responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and generating appropriate responses.
         - module_name.model.js: Defines the data structure and schema associated with the module, including database interactions.
         - module_name.routes.js: Specifies the API routes and corresponding HTTP methods for accessing the module's functionalities.

   This structured approach to organizing our source code promotes maintainability, reusability, and collaboration 
   among developers, ensuring a cohesive and scalable application architecture.


##### ENDPOINTS

   Best Practices for API Endpoint Design

   It's important to maintain clean and concise endpoint routes to enhance readability and maintainability of the API. 
   Consider structuring your endpoints with a base route followed by the entity they operate on, like so:

      - baseRoute/entity

   Avoid adding unnecessary actions or verbs to the endpoint paths, such as:

      - baseRoute/entity/updateEntity
      - baseRoute/entity/createEntity

   These distinctions can often be handled by employing different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the same endpoint. 
   Overloading the endpoint paths with additional descriptors can lead to unnecessary complexity and clutter. 
   Keep it simple and focused on the core functionality of the endpoint.

##### DEBUGGING

   To facilitate debugging and logging within the application, a backend logging service (using the PINO framework) 
   is available. The logger can be found in `src/helpers/logger`.

   ### Logger Service Overview

      The logging service is designed to capture and present messages of varying severity levels, including:

      - `info`: General information messages.
      - `debug`: Detailed debugging information.
      - `error`: Errors that may not require immediate attention but should be monitored.
      - `fatal`: Critical errors that require immediate attention.

      The service is configured to operate ONCE A REQUEST REACHES THE BACKEND AND HAS PASSED THROUGH ALL RELEVANT MIDDLEWARES.

   ### Logging Format

      Each log entry adheres to the following format:

      [YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] LEVEL (PID) <methodName (file)>: Message

      Where:
      - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`: Timestamp of when the log was recorded.
      - `LEVEL`: Severity level of the log entry (`info`, `debug`, `error`, `fatal`).
      - `PID`: Process ID where the log was generated.
      - `methodName`: Name of the method where the log was called.
      - `file:line`: File and line number where the log statement exists.
      - `Message`: Descriptive message corresponding to the log entry.

   ### How to Use

      To utilize the logger, simply export it from `src/helpers/logger` in your module and use it as follows:

      ```javascript
      const logger = require('../helpers/logger');

      // Example usage
      logger.info('Starting application...');
      logger.debug('Debugging information...');
      logger.error('An error occurred!');
      logger.fatal('Critical error! Application shutting down...');

   Ensure that appropriate logging levels (info, debug, error, fatal) are used based on the nature and severity of the message.

   This logging mechanism helps maintain clarity, traceability, and debugging efficiency throughout the application's 
   development and operation phases.


   This documentation provides a structured overview of the logging service, its capabilities, usage instructions, and the 
   expected log format. Adjustments can be made based on specific application requirements or additional functionalities of 
   the logging service.
