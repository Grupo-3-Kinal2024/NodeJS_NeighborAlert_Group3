##### CONFIGS DIRECTORY EXPLANATION

   The "configs" folder houses essential files for the configuration and proper functioning of the application. 
   Here's a breakdown of what this folder contains:

   1. server.js: This file serves as the core of the application. It's responsible for starting the server 
               and configuring all necessary routes and middlewares for the application to run correctly. 
               Additionally, it provides the logic for connecting to the database and defines routes for 
               various API endpoints.

   2. mongo.js: This file contains the necessary configuration to establish a connection with the MongoDB 
               database. It doesn't require modification, as it's preconfigured to establish the connection 
               correctly.

   The "configs" folder is crucial for the proper functioning of the application, as it contains the core logic 
   and configuration needed to start and run the server, as well as to establish a connection with the database.

   Furthermore, it's important to note that these files should be handled with caution, as they contain sensitive 
   configurations critical to the operation of the application.

   Note: Ensure to maintain the security of these files and avoid exposing sensitive information, 
   such as database credentials, in public repositories or production environments.

   Description of the "data" directory:

   The "data" directory will be solely used for testing environments, ensuring that no sensitive information is compromised here.



##### SOURCE CODE DIRECTORY EXPLANATION

   Within the src directory, we organize our codebase into distinct modules and supporting components 
   to enhance clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Here's a breakdown of each directory and its purpose:

   1. auth:
      This directory hosts functionalities related to the authentication process. 
      Primarily, it handles user authentication and authorization tasks. 
      It's important to note that the auth module stands independently outside the modules directory 
      due to its critical role in securing the application.

   2. helpers:
      The helpers directory contains utility functions or a collection of functions that offer commonly 
      used functionalities across the application. These functions aim to streamline development by 
      providing reusable code for tasks such as data manipulation, formatting, or other routine operations.

   3. middlewares:
      Middleware components reside within the middlewares directory. Middleware, in our context, acts as 
      a bridge between different parts of the application, facilitating communication and interactions. 
      Common middleware tasks include request processing, authentication, logging, error handling, and input 
      validation. Frameworks like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python) are often utilized here to streamline 
      these processes.

   4. modules:
      The modules directory serves as the primary container for encapsulating distinct features or functionalities 
      of the application. Each module resides within its own subdirectory, maintaining a clear separation of concerns. 
      
      For instance:

         - modules/user: Contains functionality related to user management.
         - modules/community: Focuses on community-related features.

      Within each module directory, you'll find the following files:

         - module_name.controller.js: Logic responsible for handling incoming requests, processing data, and generating appropriate responses.
         - module_name.model.js: Defines the data structure and schema associated with the module, including database interactions.
         - module_name.routes.js: Specifies the API routes and corresponding HTTP methods for accessing the module's functionalities.

   This structured approach to organizing our source code promotes maintainability, reusability, and collaboration 
   among developers, ensuring a cohesive and scalable application architecture.
